     * Input:
     * 20x20 grid map
     * 5 obstacles on the map with their corresponding positions
     * 5 unknown images which are located on the obstacles, image sides are unknown
     * 
     * Output:
     * Robot can move to all 5 obstacles, starting image recognition around the obstacles
     * and come back to the START position
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Exploration algorithm can be described as followed:
     * 1) Identify all the potential spots to recognize images around each obstacle
     * 
     * 2) Sort those spots (in each obstacle) in an order so that robot can go through all of them
     * without visiting a spot twice. In our case, we choose clockwise (south -> west -> north -> east)
     * 
     * 3) Robot will go to the beginning position of step 2 (b1), perform image recognition,
     * save image information, and last visit the end position of step 2 (e1)
     * We will have 5 pairs of position (b1, e1), (b2, e2), ... , (b5, e5)
     * 
     * 4) Identify how we move from 1 obstacle to another
     * We choose going from the end location of obstacle i (ei) to the begin position of unvisited obstacle k (bk): ei -> bk
     * and calculate the loss for those paths
     * 
     * 5) Since we choose clockwise order for image recognition, we should sort the order of visiting obstacles
     * anticlockwise-based, so that robot will not having much trouble in step 2
     * 
     * Loss for path ei -> bk
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Exploration process
     * - Robot starts at START region
     * 
     * - Find nearest b1
     * - Go to b1
     * - Do image recognition
     * - End at e1
     * - 
     * - Find nearest b2
     * - Go to b2
     * - Do image recognition
     * - End at e2
     * 
     * - Find nearest b3
     * - Go to b3
     * - Do image recognition
     * - End at e3
     * 
     * - Find nearest b4
     * - Go to b4
     * - Do image recognition
     * - End at e4
     * 
     * - Find nearest b5
     * - Go to b5
     * - Do image recognition
     * - End at e5
     * 
     * - Go back to START
